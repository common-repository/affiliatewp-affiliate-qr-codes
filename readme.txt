Allows affiliates to save, print, or share their affiliate URL as a QR code.

== Description ==

With the Affiliate QR Codes official free add-on, your affiliates’ URLs are automatically generated into a PNG image file. Each affiliate can easily share their image in emails, on the web, on print materials, or via social media. These QR codes have referral tracking functionality built right in! This allows your affiliates to more reliably share referral links on mobile devices.

**QR codes in the Affiliate Area**

Once installed and activated, within the Affiliate Area a QR code will be displayed in the Affiliate URLs tab. Your affiliates can click on the preview image to view and download a ready-to-share PNG file that is optimized for both scanning clarity and small file size. The QR code contains their referral URL.

**QR codes in the Affiliate Portal**

If you are using the Affiliate Portal pro add-on, a QR code will be displayed in the Referral URL section of the Affiliate URLs page. Your affiliates can click on the QR code to download it.

> This plugin requires [AffiliateWP](https://affiliatewp.com/ "AffiliateWP") v2.7 or newer in order to function.
